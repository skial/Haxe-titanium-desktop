    Invoke the installer to find and install a list of dependencies. When
    the installer is finished running, it will call the given callback.

    to the installer. <em>Currently the installer only supports Titanium.API.EQ
    dependencies.</em>

platforms: ['osx', 'linux', 'win32']
returns: void
parameters: 
    - [Array<API.Dependency>, dependencies, A list of API.Dependency to find and install.]
    - [Function, callback, A callback to invoke when the installer is finished.]
