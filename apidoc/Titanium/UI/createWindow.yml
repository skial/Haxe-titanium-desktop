namespace: Titanium.UI.createWindow
type: function
description: |
    <p>
    Create a new child window of the current window. This means that
    when the originating window is closed, the new window will be closed
    as well. If this function is called outside of the context of a window
    it will create a new top-level window.
    </p>

    <p>
    There are three ways to call this function. You may pass no arguments,
    in which case the new window will have the same configuration as the
    originating window. You may also simply pass a new absolute URL:
    <pre><code>
        Titanium.UI.createWindow("app://second_page.html");
    </code></pre>
    If the URL matches the url or url-regex field of a tiapp.xml window
    configuration, then the window will use that configuration. For more
    information see the <a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/doc/desktop/tiapp.xml">tiapp.xml guide</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    A window may also be craeated with an options object. Almost every
    field in a tiapp.xml window configuration has a corresponding field
    in the options object. Below is a call which uses every field:
    <pre><code>
        Titanium.UI.createWindow({
            id: "propertyWindow",
            url: "app://second_page.html",
            title: "My New Window",
            contents: "<html>foo!</html>"
            baseURL: "app://page_url"
            x: 300,
            y: 400,
            width: 500,
            minWidth: 500,
            maxWidth: 500,
            height: 500,
            minHeight: 500,
            maxHeight: 500,
            maximizable: true,
            minimizable: true,
            closeable: true,
            resizable: true,
            fullscreen: false,
            maximized: false,
            minimized: false,
            usingChrome: true,
            topMost: false,
            visible: true,
            transparentBackground: false,
            transparency: false
        });
    </code></pre>
