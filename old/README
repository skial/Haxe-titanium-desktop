haXe extern classes for Titanium Desktop. Titanium provides native performance, native
UI & native capabilities, with over 1,000 APIs and growing. If you can dream it, you
can build it.

I wanted to use haXe to play around with titanium desktop, so I made this. I have not used
titanium desktop before, so I might have got some things wrong, but so far everything I've
tested works.

NOTE
------
All classes apart from Titanium.hx are prefixed with TD. Any class that is accessed 
through a parent class with the same name ends with Child. All classes have comments
describing them, taken from the titanium desktop docs.

EXAMPLE
------
You will need to have appcelerator titanium developer installed. Import the project
called 'haxe-titanium test' located in folder example/ into titanium developer. Then
use compile.hxml to create the javascript source. Then launch the app through titanium 
developer.
